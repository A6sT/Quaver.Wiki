# Skins

Skins are one of the many great features of Quaver. It allows players to completely customize the look and feel of the game to their liking. With our advanced skinning system, the possibilities of what can be created are endless.

## Default Skins vs. User Skins

Quaver has multiple default skins to choose from which includes bars and arrows for the Keys game modes. It is important to note that when creating user skins, any elements not explicitly specified will be defaulted to the selected default skin. This may cause unintended results, so if you're creating an arrow skin, make sure you have the default arrow skin selected in-game and vice versa.

# Skinning FAQ

## How do I create a skin?

Skinning has a very forced organization system and needs to be done correctly in order to work properly. The following list are guides to skin each part of the game.

To get started, it'll be helpful to start with a base skin. You can download both our default bar and arrow skins [here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/janko5/myworkshopfiles/?appid=980610).

* [Gameplay Interface](/docs/Skins/Interface)
* [4K and 7K](/docs/Skins/Keys)
* [Sound Effects (SFX)](/docs/Skins/SFX)
* [Skin.ini](/docs/Skins/Skin.ini)

If you want to start creating skin elements from scratch, you will need image editing software. We recommend either of the following programs:

   - [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?promoid=PC1PQQ5T&mv=other)
   - [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org)
   - [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/index.html)
   - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/login)
   - [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com)


## Where can I download skins made by other players?

There are two ways of getting skins made by other people:

* [Quaver's Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/980610/workshop/)
  
  You can get skins in the Steam Workshop by clicking on a skin of your choice, and click Subscribe. After subscribing, Steam will download the skin files from the workshop. When the download is complete, the skin should be available in Skin Settings. Skins that you have currently subscribed to are in blue font color.

* Asking the person for the skin they're using.
  
  Some people do not upload their skins in the Steam Workshop. You may ask them for the skin but they may not give it to you.

## Can I make my own edition of someone else's skin?
Yes, you can make your own edition or use skin elements from other skins and you are allowed to upload them in the Steam Workshop.

However, we suggest giving credit to the original author of the skin if you would use their skin elements.


## How do I reload my skin in Quaver?
With the skin of your choice, reloading the skin is by pressing CTRL + S in the song selection menu or the main menu.


# Uploading a Skin to the Workshop

If you want to upload your skin to the workshop, you must abide by [the rules and guidelines](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4045-USHJ-3810). Otherwise, your skin will get reported and taken down or will get blocked by the Steam Community Moderators from uploading your skins in the workshop.

The requirements of uploading in Steam Workshop are the following to be able to upload your skin:

- Your skin folder must contain a file named *steam_workshop_preview.png* (file size must be under 1MB). The file will be used as the thumbnail of your skin.
- Your Steam account must be eligible for uploading. If you have issues uploading your skin to the workshop, [this article](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-iagk-7663) may be one of the reasons.
- You must have agreed on the [Steam Subscriber Agreement](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/).

We suggest putting the gameplay of your skin in the *steam_workshop_preview.png* so the players can see what the skin would and the file size should be under 1MB regardless of the image's resolution.
